# Trivia

## Explanation of the app
With this Trivia app you can play Trivia and there is a leaderboard that shows the scores of the users of the app. The questions asked in Trivia are generated via an API that I generated with the following API generator: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php.

## Implemented extra's
- I managed to show the Html elements that are in the questions from the API, so the questions are displayed nicely.

This extra is shown in the section "Screenshots of the app".
